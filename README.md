# Rotate-bits

This function performs a bitwise rotation on parameter a.
Explanation: when it comes to performing a rotation of b places on parameter a, it means moving bits
Parameter A, in bits to the right, when positive, (and B bits to the left, when negative). like moving
b Bits to the right, "emptied" b The left bits of parameter a .b The bits discarded from a
From his right side, they will be inserted into his left side. (Just the opposite when b is negative. The "falling" bits
from the left end of A are inserted into the empty and unique places at the right end of an example below).
The function must return the value after performing the rotation. The program must print the value before and after
the change The values will be recorded in base 10, as explained here below. 
the prints, before and after the change,
It must also be done in bases 2, 8 and 16, in addition to base 10.
